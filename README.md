# AStartAlgorithm
This repository contains implementation of A* (find path) algorithm. </br>
Input data for algorithm is a file, path of which should be passed to program by `-path` key (For instance, `-path=/Users/user/Documents/Input Data.txt`). </br>
This file represents a field, where every cell marked by symbol.</br>
#
There are following agreed symbols: </br>
A - initial position </br>
B - target position </br>
X - cell with obstacle </br>
O - empty cell </br>
#
When program finishes, a result will be displayed on console</br>
